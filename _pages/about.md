## About Me  

I am a **Bachelor of Applied Science in Electronics Engineering** from **Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya (PENS)** with expertise in embedded systems, control systems, and artificial intelligence. My passion lies in **marine robotics**, with experience in developing systems such as AUVs, ROVs, and ASVs.  

I have gained strong **hands-on experience** in intelligent robotic systems, from embedded programming and control systems to computer vision and ROS-based autonomy. I have led and contributed to several **national robotics competitions**, **real-world projects**, and **industry internships**, collaborating with both academic and professional partners in advancing robotics applications.  

My **ikigai is in robotics.** I believe robotics is the space where my skills, passion, and purpose converge. I aspire to become a **professional in robotics**, contributing not only in academia but also in industry, by building autonomous systems that bring real impact in complex environments.
