Bachelor of Applied Science in Electronics Engineering with a solid foundation in embedded systems, control systems, and artificial intelligence. I have a strong passion for robotics, especially in the field of marine robotics, where I consistently contribute to research and competitions involving Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), and Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs).

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have demonstrated consistency in pursuing hands-on experience with intelligent robotic systems from control systems and embedded programming to computer vision and ROS-based autonomy. I have led and been part of several national-level marine robotics competitions and offshore collaborative projects, including working on actual rigs and real-world surveys, and remained consistent in this field through my final project. 

I enjoy working at the intersection of hardware and intelligent software, building solutions that operate autonomously in complex environments. I am committed to continuous learning and excited to contribute to future innovations in the robotics and marine technology industries.
