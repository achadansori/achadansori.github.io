## Autonomous Semi Submarine Drone for KKCTBN 2022

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/projects/competition/assv_2022/assv-1.jpg" title="Semi Submarine Drone Components" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Overview
Participated in the **2022 KKCTBN National Competition** with an autonomous semi-submarine drone, designed to navigate both above and below the water's surface in accordance with the competition's mission.  

### Contribution
- **Electrical System Architecture**: Engineered propulsion control, power management, and waterproof cabling aligned with the mechanical enclosure.  
- **Custom PCB Design**: Fabricated compact PCBs for high system reliability in marine conditions.  
- **Autonomous Logic Development**: Implemented microcontroller-based mission execution for pre-programmed submerged and surface maneuvers.  
- **Vision & FPGA Integration**: Integrated **NI myRIO FPGA with Computer Vision** for object detection and decision-making, interfacing with MultiWii Arduino for navigation.  
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Worked with software and mechanical teams to ensure system compatibility, performance, and safety in submerged environments.  

### Results
- Successfully integrated electrical, mechanical, and software subsystems into a working prototype with semi-submersible autonomous capability.  
- Demonstrated consistent performance during field trials and mission.  
- Achieved **finalist position** in KKCTBN 2022, validating the system design and laying the foundation for further marine robotics development.
