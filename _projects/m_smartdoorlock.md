## Smartdoorlock: Fingerprint and PIN Authentication

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/projects/academic/smartdoorlock/cover.jpg" title="Smartdoorlock Prototype" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Overview
A functional **smart doorlock system** designed as part of the **Sensors and Actuators course**.  
Features **multi-factor authentication** using both **fingerprint** and **PIN input** for enhanced security.  
Built to be directly applicable in real-world use, including a working prototype.  

### Contribution
- Led the end-to-end development of the system, coordinating mechanical, electrical, and programming aspects.  
- Integrated multiple hardware components:  
  - Fingerprint sensor for biometric verification  
  - Keypad for PIN entry  
  - Solenoid lock for actuation  
  - LCD screen for user interface  
  - Arduino Nano as the core controller  
- Wrote firmware to manage authentication logic and control system responses.  
- Managed team workflow, ensured proper documentation, and delivered the system on schedule.  

### Results
- Successfully deployed a working prototype that demonstrated **secure door access** with both biometric and numeric authentication.  
- Received high evaluation from lecturers for technical execution and practical application.
