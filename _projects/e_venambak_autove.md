## AutoVe: Automatic Aerator for Traditional Fish Farmers

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/projects/work/venambak_autove/autove-1.jpg" title="AutoVe Version 2 Prototype" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Overview
AutoVe Version 2 is an upgraded prototype of an **affordable automatic aerator system** for traditional fish farmers, currently in early development.  
It improves upon the first version by introducing more advanced control, mobility, and energy autonomy â€” shifting from a microcontroller (**ESP32**) to a **Mini PC** platform, and preparing for future AI features such as **collision avoidance** and **autonomous waypoint navigation**.

### Contribution
- Replaced the ESP32 microcontroller with a **Mini PC (Linux-based)** to allow easier development, real-time processing, and future AI integration.  
- Redesigned the **power system** from an AC-based car battery to a DC motor system that supports **solar panel charging**.  
- Developed and tested **manual control via smartphone** using a local wireless interface.  
- Implemented a **dual-mode framework** (manual and autonomous waypoint algorithm).  
- Built early **hardware schematics and modular wiring** to support sensor and actuator expansion.  

### Result
- Completed an early working prototype with **manual smartphone control** and **solar-compatible power system**.  
- Laid the groundwork for future implementation of **AI collision avoidance** and autonomous behaviors.  
- Progressed toward a more intelligent, mobile, and **off-grid aerator solution** tailored for traditional farmers in rural environments.
