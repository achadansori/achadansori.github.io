## Affordable Smart Feeder for Farmers

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/projects/work/venambak_feeederve/kelengkapan-feederve.png" title="System Completeness" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Overview
During an internship at **Venambak**, a startup focused on aquaculture and agricultural technology, I was involved in developing a **solar-powered smart feeder** designed to assist traditional farmers in automating the feeding process.  
The system was built to operate in remote or off-grid areas using renewable solar energy, aiming to reduce manual labor and improve feeding consistency.

### Contribution
- Continued and improved the system using an **ESP32 microcontroller**, and redesigned the PCB from double-layer to single-layer to accelerate the production process.  
- Integrated a **solar panel** to enable fully off-grid operation.  
- Identified and resolved **EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)** issues that were affecting system stability.  
- Participated in an initial **mini-production phase** over 5 months, resulting in the successful assembly of approximately 50 smart feeder electronic units, while continuing R&D for further improvements.  

### Result
- The system operated reliably on **solar power**, with improved performance and stability.  
- Simplified PCB design enabled faster and more efficient production.  
- Provided an **affordable, scalable, and sustainable solution** for traditional and smallholder farmers in rural areas.
