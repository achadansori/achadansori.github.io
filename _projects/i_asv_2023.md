### Overview
Developed an **autonomous surface vehicle** for the **KKCTBN 2023 competition**, focusing on waypoint navigation with **RTK GPS** and early-stage deep learning integration using **YOLOv4** for object detection. The project explored AI-assisted control tailored for **tourism applications** in marine environments.  

### Contribution
- **Team Leadership**: Led the PENSHIP team, managing electronics, programming, and navigation divisions.  
- **Mission System**: Designed and implemented RTK GPS-based positioning for high-accuracy waypoint navigation.  
- **Computer Vision**: Developed early computer vision obstacle detection using **YOLOv4** on Jetson Nano.  
- **Software Architecture**: Built scalable architecture for autonomous decision-making with future AI expansion.  

### Results
- Successfully completed mission demonstrations in **KKCTBN 2023 trials**.  
- Marked as an **initial milestone** toward deploying smart autonomous vessels for tourism.
