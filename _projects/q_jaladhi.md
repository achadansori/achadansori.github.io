## Jaladhi: Autonomous Surface Vehicle with Collision Avoidance

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/projects/academic/jaladhi/jaladhi.jpg" title="Jaladhi Prototype" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Overview
**Jaladhi** is an advanced development of the previous **PKM Jalavahana project**, focused on enabling **autonomous navigation for offshore energy site exploration**.  
The system is equipped with **real-time collision avoidance capabilities** following the **COLREGs (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea)**.  
The vehicle integrates computer vision using **YOLOv8 optimized with TensorRT** for fast object detection and **RPLIDAR A2** for distance measurement, enabling autonomous decision-making in dynamic offshore environments.  

### Contribution
- Designed and implemented an **obstacle avoidance system** combining deep learning-based visual perception and LiDAR-based proximity detection.  
- Developed a **multi-sensor fusion strategy** to enable safe and rule-compliant navigation.  
- Tuned the system to adhere to **COLREGs**, ensuring realistic maritime behavior.  
- Built and tested the entire pipeline on **Jetson Nano** using **ROS Noetic**, integrating motor control, sensor data processing, and autonomous decision logic.  
- Led the final presentation and system demonstration in the competition.  

### Results
- Awarded **2nd Place** in the **Final Project Competition** at **Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya (PENS)**.  
- Recognized for **innovation** and **practical implementation** in real-world offshore scenarios.
