### Overview
Represented **Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya (PENS)** in the 2023 **Indonesian Underwater Robot Contest (KRBAI)** by developing a fully autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of completing both mandatory and innovation missions.  

### Missions
- **Mandatory Mission**: Navigate autonomously through two gates placed 10 meters apart while maintaining stable heading and depth.  
- **Innovation Mission**: Perform underwater cable inspection — the robot follows a submerged cable using **HSV-based lane detection** processed on a Jetson Nano.  

### Contribution
- **Team Leadership**: Led a multidisciplinary team covering mechanical, electrical, software, and non-technical divisions.  
- **Electrical System Design**: Built the complete electrical system including motor drivers, power distribution, and waterproof circuitry.  
- **Autonomous Navigation Development**:  
  1. Implemented **HSV-based lane detection** for cable following on Jetson Nano.  
  2. Integrated Jetson Nano (vision & mission logic) with Arduino (low-level motor control).  
  3. Tuned controllers for stable depth and directional control.  
- **Project Management**: Organized schedules, preparation, and overall competition strategy.  

### Results
- Successfully completed missions in real underwater testing conditions.  
- Achieved **2nd Place (Regional)** and **3rd Place (National)** at KRBAI 2023.
