### Overview  
A real-time defect detection system was developed using **deep learning and computer vision**, deployed on the **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** platform.  
The system was designed to assist the **Quality Control (QC)** process in a manufacturing environment by automatically identifying defective products based on **visual anomalies**.  
This project was carried out during a **6-month internship at PT Toshin Prima Fine Blanking**.  

### Contribution  
- Designed and trained a **custom YOLOv4 model** using labeled datasets of product defects.  
- Optimized the model with **TensorRT** for high-speed inference on Jetson Nano.  
- Integrated the system with a **Logitech Brio camera** for high-resolution image capture.  
- Developed a **Python-based application** to visualize, classify, and log detection results.  
- Deployed the system on the **production line** to assist QC operators during live inspections.  

### Result  
- Achieved **real-time detection speed of up to 29.8 FPS** with an **F1-score of 0.9945**.  
- Successfully detected **multiple defect types** with high precision and reduced manual inspection time.  
- Contributed to improving **product quality** while **minimizing human error** in the QC process.
