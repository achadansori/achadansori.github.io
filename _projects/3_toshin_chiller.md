### Overview
As part of a 6-month internship at **PT Toshin Prima Fine Blanking**, a web-based IoT system was developed to monitor the operational status of a chiller machine in real time.  
The goal was to support predictive maintenance and minimize unexpected downtime by enabling continuous remote monitoring.

### Contribution
- Designed and built a sensor system using **Arduino** to collect temperature, pressure, and current data from the chiller.  
- Connected the Arduino to a **Raspberry Pi**, which served as the local database and processing unit.  
- Developed **serial communication and data logging** scripts using Python.  
- Built a **web-based dashboard** using Flask (Python) and JavaScript to visualize real-time data.  
- Deployed the system on the local factory network for access by the maintenance division.  

### Result
- Enabled **real-time remote monitoring** of the chiller machine, reducing downtime risk.  
- Helped the maintenance team to **detect early warning signs** of failure.  
- Improved **maintenance planning** and performance tracking within the factory.
