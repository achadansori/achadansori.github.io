### Overview  
An underwater survey was conducted over **7 days (August 1â€“7, 2024)** using a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) around the **RIG Taurus site** following a structural collapse incident.  
This project was a collaboration between **Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya (PENS)** and **Pertamina Hulu Energi**, aiming to assess **operational safety** and the **hull condition** of the rig.  

### Contribution  
- Served as the **ROV pilot** and **underwater visual data analyst**.  
- Operated the ROV to a depth of **20 meters** for underwater documentation.  
- Analyzed recorded video footage to assess **structural integrity** and potential risks.  
- Led the team and trained members in **ROV operation**.  

### Result  
- Produced **visual reports** and **technical analysis** used by PHE WMO in operational safety evaluation.  
- Identified **three critical areas** around the hull and seabed requiring further attention.
