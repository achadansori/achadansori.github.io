## Balancing Submarine Drone with MultiWii

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/projects/fun/submarinedrone/submarnedrone.png" title="Submarine Drone Prototype" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Overview
This **personal project** explores the development of a **self-balancing submarine drone** using the **MultiWii flight controller**, originally designed for aerial drones.  
The system integrates an **MPU6050 IMU** and applies **PID-based control** to maintain stability in pitch and roll while submerged.  
The aim was to simulate the control behavior of an **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)** with a focus on **low-cost, open-source hardware**.  

### Contribution
- Interfaced the **MPU6050 sensor** with the MultiWii system using I2C.  
- Modified the **MultiWii firmware** to enable underwater balancing logic.  
- Implemented **PID tuning** for dynamic stability.  
- Performed testing and logging data in controlled water environments.  

### Results
- Repurposed the **MultiWii system** for **underwater stabilization**.  
- Achieved **basic pitch and roll balance control** underwater.  
- Built a testable prototype demonstrating key principles in **AUV dynamics**.  
- Shared the complete source code and documentation publicly for community learning and future development.
