### Overview
A multidisciplinary research project under **Indonesia’s Program Kreativitas Mahasiswa (PKM)**, funded by **Belmawa (Ministry of Education and Culture)**.  
Developed an **Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV)** to conduct environmental and geospatial surveys around **Pulau Gili Ketapang**, a site identified with offshore wind energy potential.  

### Contribution
- **System Leadership**: Led the full design and development, managing a cross-functional team.  
- **Electrical System**: Designed motor control, solar-powered energy management, sensor integration (LiDAR, GPS, IMU), and waterproof electronics.  
- **Computer Vision**: Integrated **Jetson Nano with YOLOv8** for marine biota detection and sea surface condition analysis.  
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Built **ROS-based architecture** for waypoint navigation using **Pixhawk and RTK GPS**.  
- **Management**: Coordinated proposal writing, documentation, and stakeholder communication for funding and deployment.  

### Results
- Conducted **successful sea trials** with autonomous navigation and real-time vision around Gili Ketapang.  
- Validated capability for remote data collection in offshore wind turbine planning.  
- Selected as a **national finalist** in the PKM Research & Technology category and officially funded by **Belmawa**.  
- Publicly showcased at **[jalavahana.org](https://jalavahana.org)** as a national-level student research initiative.
