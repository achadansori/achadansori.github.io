## Bicopter Position Control System with Arduino-Based PID Control

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/projects/academic/bicopterpid/bicopter.png" title="Bicopter Prototype" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Overview
Developed a **bicopter position control system** using an **Arduino Nano**.  
Implemented **PID control** based on **MPU6050 sensor data** processed with a **Kalman filter**.  
System output controls two **brushless motors** via **ESCs**, with real-time monitoring on a **16x2 LCD**.  

### Contribution
- Coded the **PID control algorithm** and integrated **Kalman filtering**.  
- Connected and configured **MPU6050** via I2C, ESCs, potentiometer, and LCD.  
- Tuned PID parameters through testing to optimize response.  

### Results
- Achieved stable response with:
  - Rise time: **0.56 s**  
  - Overshoot: **9.58%**  
  - Settling time: **5.37 s**  
- Final PID values: **Kp = 0.7, Ti = 1.2, Td = 0.5**  
- System responded well to external disturbances with minimal steady-state error.
