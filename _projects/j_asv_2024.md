{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/projects/competition/asv_2024/kapal.jpg" title="ASV Offshore Support Prototype" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Overview
Designed and developed an **Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV)** prototype for the **2024 Kontes Kapal Indonesia (KKI)** competition. The theme focused on **offshore support and exploration**, simulating tasks in a real-world controlled maritime environment.  

### Contribution
- **Embedded System**: Built on **Jetson Nano** with **ROS Noetic** for modular and scalable control.  
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Programmed waypoint-based missions with sensor input from **GPS, IMU, and RP Lidar**.  
- **Computer Vision**: Integrated **YOLOv8-based object detection** for obstacle recognition and collision avoidance.  
- **System Integration**: Handled camera modules, deep learning perception, and interfacing with low-level controllers (**Pixhawk, Arduino**).  

### Results
- Successfully tested prototype in the competition arena.  
- Demonstrated **functional waypoint navigation** and **real-time image-based object detection** with YOLOv8.  
- Selected as a **finalist team** for the **KKI 2024 national-level competition**.
