## Eyesight: Machine Vision for Enhancing Quality and Production Efficiency

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/projects/academic/eyesight/eyesight-2.jpg" title="Eyesight System Prototype" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Overview
**Eyesight** is a computer vision-based quality inspection system developed as part of the **Google Bangkit 2024 capstone project**.  
The system is designed specifically for **micro and small enterprises (UMKM)** in the manufacturing sector, aiming to provide an accessible and cost-effective solution for defect detection.  
Utilizing **YOLOv8** for object detection and deployed on the **Jetson Nano**, the system operates entirely offline to support areas with limited connectivity.  

### Contribution
- **Machine Learning Lead**:
  - Collected and labeled visual data relevant to UMKM products.  
  - Trained a custom **YOLOv8** model using Ultralytics and optimized it for real-time inference with **TensorRT**.  
  - Deployed the model on Jetson Nano for **edge-based inspection**.  
  - Collaborated with cloud and mobile teams for system integration and UI.  

### Results
- Successfully demonstrated **real-time product inspection** on edge devices.  
- Increased awareness of **AI-driven quality control** in small-scale industries.  
- Received **positive feedback** for its potential to support local manufacturers through automation and efficiency improvements.  
- Recognized by **Bangkit reviewers** as an initiative with **scalable social impact**.
